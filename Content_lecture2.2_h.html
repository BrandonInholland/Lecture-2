		<h1> My top favorites </h1>
		<h2> Why did i choose them</h2>
		<p>
			Pacific Rim is my favorite movie because I love Sci-Fi and when i first watch the movie I thought it was the best idea ever and is the only movie i can keep rewatching without getting bored
		</p>	
		<p>	World of Warcraft is my favorite game because I started playing Runescape as a kid and once I found World of Warcraft it was to me a bigger and better version of Runescape, with interesting lore 
			and beautiful design.
